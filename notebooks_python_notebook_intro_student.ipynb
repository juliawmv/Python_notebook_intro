The package also contains sub-packages inside it.\n\n**Library**: The library is a collection of codes with related functionality that allow you to perform many tasks without writing your own code. It is a reusable chunk of code that we can use by importing it in our program.  We can just use it by importing that library and calling the method of that library with period(.).
